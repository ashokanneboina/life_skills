# NoSQL Database
 NoSQL Database stores data in more natural and flexible way.While SQL stores more structured and Traditonal way. NoSQL prioritize scalability,flexibility and high performance over fixed structure.
 In NoSQL there are five major types of  NoSQL databases.Those are 
 
 - Document-oriented databases
 - Key-value databases
 - Wide-column stores
 - Graph databases
 - Multi-model databases

 ## Document-oriented databases

- A document-oriented database stores data in documents
- Each document is self-contained 
- It supports nested data structure
- No joins are needed
- MongoDB uses Document-oriented databases
- This is mostly used in Web applications

## Key-value databases
- Key-value databases stores data as key : value pair
- This is the fastest NoSQL model 
- It has very simple structure
- It does not allows querying ov value fields
- Redis uses Key-Value databases
- This is widley used for Caching

## Wide-Column Stores

- Wide-Column stores data in column families
- Each row can have different coloumns
- It is Highly salable
- It is best for large writes
- Schema is flexible per row
- Apache Cassandra uses Wide-Column stores
- It is mostly preffered for Big data

## Graph Databses
- In Graph Databases data stored as nodes and edges
- Nodes store infromation about people
- And edges store information about relationships
- It is very fast in relationship queries
- Neo4j uses Graph Database
- It is widley used in Social networks

## Multi-Model Databases
- It supports multiple data models in one database
- It is like mixed database it combines all database models 
- Reduces need for multiple databases
- It has very flexible architecture
- ArangoDB uses Multi-Model Databases
- It is prefferd for complex applications

# How NoSQL improves performance
- It supports Horizontal Scaling
- It supports Sharding 
- It has very flexible schema
- It stores Denormalized Data
- It has built-in replication
- It has optimized Data Models

So, Using NoSQL improves overall performance and it is best for Scaling also.
