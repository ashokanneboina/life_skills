# Tiny Habits


### Question 1 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea for me in the video is  using an exciting habit to develop a new habit. Until now I have never thought that our old habits can help develop new habits. And I think it works really well.

### Question 2 - How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
* M - Motivation
* A - Ability
* P - Prompt 
There are three kinds of prompts external, internal, and action prompts. I prefer action prompts. It is like doing a new habit after an older habit. A new habit must be a very small habit so it does not require a huge amount of motivation so it can be performed easily, and after performing it, we get more confident. And it will become a habit.

### Question 3 - Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
Celebrating after each successful completion of a habit is important because it increases our confidence and makes us more motivated to continue doing that habit. When we acknowledge even small progress, we feel a sense of achievement, which creates a positive emotion. This positive feeling encourages us to repeat the behavior again. Over time, repeated celebration strengthens our belief that we can maintain the habit, making it easier and more automatic.

### Question 4 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea for me was the British Cycling transformation under Dave Brailsford. They didn’t change everything at once they improved small things by just 1% each day. Over time, those small improvements added up and led to huge success.

### Question 5 - What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The book is saying that change of true habit begins with identity change. Instead of focusing on results, you should focus the type of person you want to become. When habits become part of our identity We are more likely stick to those habits.

### Question 6 - Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
From the book's perspective  to become a habit easier the main factor is friction. If we reduce the friction that means less effort is needed for that habit so it becomes easier. 

-----

### Question 7 - Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
From the book's perspective  to become a bad habit harder to do here also the main factor is friction. if we increase friction that means more effort is needed to perform that bad habit. So it is very likely we don't want to perform that habit.
